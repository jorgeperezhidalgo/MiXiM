v2.1
* organized inter-module dependent initialisation code

v2.0
+ introduced Mixnet - compatibility modules for using MiXiM NICs within INET 
  networks
+ divided BaseArps addressing and ARP functionality into two separate interfaces
  to become more compatible with real ARPs which do not implement addressing
* fixed use of wrong connection manager in MAC layer when using multiple 
  connection managers (thanks to "David" from the omnetpp list for reporting)
* fixed a problem with ChannelInfo where it throw away channel information 
  although it was still needed to answer a ChannelSenseRequest
* fixed not canceled CCA timer on backoff (bug tracker id: 3083767)


v1.2
+ added port of 802154 narrowband phy and mac layer of mobility-fw2 for omnet 4
  from Jérôme Rousselot
+ added global blackboard functionality to BaseWorldUtility
+ introduced "csma" module which implements a generic CSMA mac protocol and will
  replace CSMAMacLayer in the future
+ added depth dependent scaled display of hosts when GUI and 3-D is used
+ made members of Move protected, added functions for member access
  - 'setDirectionByVector' replaces the direct access to the member 'direction'
  - 'setDirectionByTarget' replaces the method 'setDirection'
+ BaseMobilitys host coordinates can be set to random values indepentently now
+ gave networks of examples more meaningfull and consistent names (same as the
  example)
+ renamed executeables for examples from "MiXiM" to <example name>
+ divided MacControlInfo into MacToNetwControlInfo and NetwToMacControlInfo
+ added a wizard to create a basic MiXiM-network as well as a wizard for
  creating your own AnalogueModel
+ added, updated or extended documentation for Radio, RSAM, ChannelInfo,
  MiXiM-basics, mobility, border-handling and CSMA MAC-Layer 
+ changed scheduling priority of AirFrames to slightly higher than normal to
  ensure channel consistency
+ added utility-method 'addDiscontinuity' to MappingUtils which provides a
  workaround to represent discontinuities in mappings by defining two entries as
  close as possible to each other
+ changed default signal created by BaseMacLayer's 'createSignal'-method to use
  a rectangular function for TX-power
+ changed BaseDeciders handling of ChannelSenseRequests for better support of
  rssi based idle/busy state
+ removed ModuleAccess and BaseArpAccess and replaced calls to them by using
  class FindModule
+ changed SNRThresholdDecider to evaluate the received energy level to decide
  whether the channel is idle or busy (before the channel was only busy if the
  decider actually received, meaning decoded, a signal)
* fixed memory leak when propagation delay is simulated
* fixed a bug in the calculated receiving power of a signal which caused it to
  be greater zero before and after its signal in certain cases
* fixed wrong calculation of position on "WRAP" border handling in BaseMobility
* fixed missing connections when the cells from ConnectionManager do not cover
  the playground size exactly
* fixed increasing heap memory usage while hosts sending AirFrames but wheren't
  receiving any. This was caused by RSAM tracking every radio state although
  there wheren't any Signals on the channel to attenuate.

v1.1
+ added port of EnergyFramework written by Laura Marie Feeney
+ added "headerLength" parameter to physical layer and fixed wrong MacPkt length
  in Mac80211
* fixed wrong initialization order of static time and frequency Dimension
  members by introducing time-/frequency_static() wrapper methods

v1.0
- first release
