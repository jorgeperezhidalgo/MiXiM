Purpose and History
===================
MiXiM (mixed simulator) is a simulator for wireless and mobile networks 
using the OMNeT++ simulation engine.
MiXiM is available at http://mixim.sourceforge.net/

MiXiM is the attempt to merge several OMNeT++ simulators written to support
mobile and wireless simulations.

Those prdecessors of MiXiM are:
- ChSim

  (c) by Universitaet Paderborn
- Mac Simulator
  http://www.consensus.tudelft.nl/software.html
  (c) by Technische Universiteit Delft
- Mobility Framework
  http://mobility-fw.sourceforge.net/
  (c) by Technische Universitaet Berlin, Telecommunication Networks Group
- Positif Framework
  http://www.consensus.tudelft.nl/software.html
  (c) by Technische Universiteit Delft

MiXiM further includes the "Mixnet" project which provides compatibility modules
and documentation in case you want to use MiXiM together with the INET
framework. For details on Mixnet and INET please take a look at its README file
in MiXiM's "inet" folder.

Installation
============
For installation instructions please see the INSTALL file


How to start
============
A step-by-step guide on how to start with MiXiM can be found in MiXiM's wiki at:
http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mixim/wiki/StepByStep

MiXiM contains wizards for the project-creation-wizard in the OMNeT++ IDE.
These are:
* a wizard to create a basic MiXiM-network by configuring the hosts from
predefines application layers, NIC protocols and mobility modules as well
as choosing the playground topology.
* a wizard to create a simple MiXiM-network. The hosts contain an analogue model
which can be basically configured in the wizard. This network is useful
to implement and test a new analogue model.

To create a new project using MiXiM's wizards please go to:
"File -> New -> OMNeT++ Project...", name your project, and in the next step
select the wizard to be used. It will present the configuration options
during the next step(s). When the creation process has finished,
the new MiXiM-network is ready to be built and run.
