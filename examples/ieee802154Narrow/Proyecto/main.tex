Nobody can doubt the importance of technology in our lives. This technology helps us in many applications. 
Some of them can be done without any environment's knowledge, but many others cannot. Whenever the situation is an important
issue (obtaining some information of the place I am, how to reach a determinate room, how full my fridge is \ldots), a way
to detect our position is needed.

Many systems try to fulfill this task, but not all are suitable in all scenarios. 802.15.4 beacon-less \ac{WSN} are chosen as an easy, cheap, 
low consumption and portable structure to achieve this aim. There are different ways to obtain a specific position. In this 
work, \ac{RSSI} from received packets will be used. The more \ac{RSSI} values and the more strength, the more exactitude obtained, but also 
the more energy is needed. Energy is hence an important parameter in this process. Trying to reduce its consumption, 
this work suggests a high configurable protocol which permits to adjust this energy-exactitude compromise as needed, depending
on the context. In this work a framework for the OmNet++ network simulator is de\-veloped and different situations are 
analyzed in order to show the improvement of this protocol compared to existing ones.
