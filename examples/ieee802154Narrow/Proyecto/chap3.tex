\chapter{Protocol Design}
\label{chap:protocoldesign}

In the state of the art, there are different protocols constructed over \ac{IEEE} 802.15.4, like ZigBee, WirelessHART, 6LoWPAN \ldots \ some
are prepared for low consumption, others build different applications, but almost none of them are focused in localization. In the
department \ac{LPL} and \ac{OLP} \cite{LPLandOLP} protocols were proposed for this purpose. This protocols are based in \ac{IEEE} 802.15.4 and specifically 
designed for localization. In the next section a brief overview will be given, for a deeper view, please consult \cite{LPLandOLP}.

\section{High Configurable Protocol proposal}

From the Table \ref{tab:wsn_applications} (page~\pageref{tab:wsn_applications}) where different applications for \ac{WSN} where stated, it is possible
to extract 4 different kind of nodes.
