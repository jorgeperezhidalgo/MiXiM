Mixnet Framework
================

Mixnet is a project contained in MiXiM's "inet" folder which provides all
modules, examples and documentation concerning using MiXiM and the INET 
framework together in the same network.

The INET framework is independent from MiXiM. It is an open-source communication
networks simulation package providing models for several Internet protocols like
TCP, IP, UDP, Ethernet, PPP and MPLS with LDP and RSVP-TE signalling. The INET
framework can be found here: 
	http://inet.omnetpp.org/

Mixnet connects INET's application layer, IP-stack and non-wireless NICs with
MiXiM's NICs and mobility modules. Thus, using Mixnet, a node in a simulation
may contain modules of INET and MiXiM.


Getting started
---------------

To set up and run Mixnet, you need:
    * MiXiM (since 2.0)
    * The "inet4mixnet" fork from github: http://github.com/mixim/inet4mixnet
      * The INET framework is a framework for TCP/IP networks developed 
        independently of MiXiM. The original framework can be found at 
      		http://inet.omnetpp.org/
      * The INET branch we provide is only a branch which has been made
        compatible with MiXiM by removing all wireless related modules. We did
        not add any further functionality to it.
    
How to prepare MiXiM, INET and Mixnet:
       
INET: 	1. Download "inet4mixnet" from 
		 	http://github.com/mixim/inet4mixnet/tarball/v1.0
      	2. Import the downloaded "inet4mixim" project into your OMNeT IDE
      	
MiXiM: 	If not already done install MiXiM and add its project to your OMNeT IDE
       	(see MiXiM's INSTALL-file in the MiXiM folder)
      
Mixnet: In case you didn't choose to import Mixnet during the installation of 
		MiXiM you can do it now following these steps (otherwise you can 
		ignore them):
		    1.  Choose "File->Import..." from the menu
		    2.  Choose "Existing projects into workspace"
		    3.  Select "Select root directory" and click "Browse"
		    4.  Browse to MiXiM's "inet" directory and click "Ok"
		    5.  Under "Projects" you should see and choose "Mixnet"
		    6.  Enable "Copy projects into workspace"
		    7.  Click "Finish"
    
Now your OMNeT IDE should contain all three projects: "MiXiM", "inet" and
"Mixnet". Choose "Project->Build All" from the menu to build all of them. 
If the build process was successful you can try to start one of the example
networks from Mixnet's "examples" directory.

As a next step you can use the examples as templates for your own simulation
networks or have a look at the documentation (see next section).


Documentation

Mixnet's API-documentation can be found in the doc directory.
