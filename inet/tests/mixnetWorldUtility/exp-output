<!> Module OmnetTestNetwork.world: Could not find a connection manager module in the network!.

Passed: MixnetWorldUtility should be present in Test simulation.
Passed: Getting mixim address from empty database (default).
Passed: Getting mixim address from empty database (broadcast).
Passed: Getting mixim address for first added pair.
Passed: Getting mixim address for not added pair.
Passed: Getting mixim address for first added pair.
Passed: Getting mixim address for second added pair.
Passed: Getting mixim address for first added pair.
Passed: Getting mixim address for second added pair.

<!> Module OmnetTestNetwork.test: Overwriting existing mapping for INET MAC 0A-AA-00-00-00-01 to MiXiM MAC 1 with MiXiM MAC 3!.

Passed: Getting mixim address for mixim duplicate.

<!> Module OmnetTestNetwork.test: Overwriting existing mapping for MiXiM MAC 1 to INET MAC 0A-AA-00-00-00-01 with INET MAC 0A-AA-00-00-00-03!.

Passed: Getting mixim address for mixim duplicate.
Passed: Getting mixim address for inet duplicate.

<!> Module OmnetTestNetwork.test: Overwriting existing mapping for INET MAC 0A-AA-00-00-00-01 to MiXiM MAC 3 with MiXiM MAC 1!.


<!> Module OmnetTestNetwork.test: Overwriting existing mapping for MiXiM MAC 1 to INET MAC 0A-AA-00-00-00-03 with INET MAC 0A-AA-00-00-00-01!.

Passed: Getting mixim address for mixim duplicate.
Passed: Getting mixim address for inet duplicate.

<!> Module OmnetTestNetwork.test: Added an address pair whose MiXiM-address has the same value as the error value "NoMacPairFound". This either means you are using another addressing scheme for MiXiM than the default one or OMNeT++ has changed the way it assigns module ids..

Passed: Getting mixim address for error pair.
Passed: Getting mixim address for second pair.
